ConsoleChat
===========

This program was made as a personal project to learn Java network programming. The concept of it is rather simple, all it does is send messages to a server which, in turn, sends the message to everyone else (aside from some other commands added). Although the license does say GNU GPLv3, this license will not trully be enforced, however, take into account that if you make your programs open-source others like you will be able to learn from them.
